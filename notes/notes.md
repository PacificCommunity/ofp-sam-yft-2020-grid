Page 18 in the YFT stock assessment report:

95 length classes (10 to 200 cm in 2 cm bins)

200 weight classes (1 to 200 kg in 1 kg bins)

Nick mentioned that it would be good to check if `parest flag 387` was set in
the YFT 2020 assessment, where values 0 and 1 would specify parameter scaling.
This is relevant when switching from the old (2020) to the current (2022) model
executable.

It doesn't look like `parest flag 387` was used in the 2020 assessment.
