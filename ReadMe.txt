These are the result files for the 2020 yellowfin stock assessment. All models from the structural uncertainty 
grid are included in the file.

The MFCL version that was used in the assessment is version 2.0.7.0. Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are 
available to download at the MULTIFAN-CL web site at https://mfcl.spc.int/

Each folder is a single model run from the uncertainty grid where the name of the folder indicates the value 
of the axis of uncertainty which were:

Growth: OtolithGrowth = growth curve estimated externally from otolith data, ModalGrowth = growth curve fixed 
at estimates from the size composition data, CondAgeGrowth = growth curve estimated by the conditional 
age-at-length data and size composition within the assessment model
Size composition scaling factor: Size20 = divisor of 20, Size60 = divisor of 60, Size200 = divisor of 200, 
Size500 = divisor of 500
Steepness: H0.65, H0.8, H0.95
Tag mixing period: 1 = less than 1 quarter excluded, 2 = less than 2 quarters excluded

The Diagnostic Model is CondAgeGrowth_Size50_H0.8_Mix2

All models were run using MULTIFAN-CL on LINUX version 2.0.7.0

The MFCL results files have the file extension .rep and can be opened in a text editor or in the MFCL viewer, 
which can be downloaded from https://mfcl.spc.int/
